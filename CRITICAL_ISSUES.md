# Critical Issues - Quick Reference

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. Settings Page ‚Äì Post-Launch QA
The settings workflow is implemented (`lib/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`) and persists preferences via `SharedPreferencesSettingsRepository`. Focus now on regression coverage (persistence failures, reset flows), verifying theme toggles propagate through the app shell, and confirming web/desktop builds gracefully handle SharedPreferences fallbacks.

### 2. Help Page ‚Äì Content & Discoverability
The interactive Help hub is live (`lib/presentation/pages/help_page.dart`) with navigation for major topics. Remaining work involves validating copy for each section, adding missing media/tutorial links, instrumenting analytics for popular topics, and ensuring the quick-start dialog is reachable through accessibility services.

### 3. Automated Test Coverage
Unit and widget suites are still sparse. Populate `test/unit/models`, `test/unit/algorithms`, `test/unit/services`, and `test/widget/` with coverage for core models, algorithm edge cases, repository error handling, and high-value widgets (canvas, algorithm panels, settings, help). Align with the gaps captured in `TEST_COVERAGE_ASSESSMENT.md`.

### 4. Performance & Load Handling
Large automata and long-running simulations can degrade responsiveness. Profile canvas rendering, algorithm execution, and persistence I/O on mid-tier devices. Add benchmarks or stress scenarios that mirror classroom-sized automata and validate frame pacing on mobile.

### 5. Accessibility & Inclusive Design
Ensure screens expose semantic labels, keyboard navigation, and sufficient touch targets. Audit Settings and Help for screen-reader order, verify dialog focus management, and introduce high-contrast themes or toggles aligned with WCAG guidance.

## üîß QUICK ACTIONS
- **Settings QA**: Add widget/integration tests for load/save/reset, confirm localization readiness, document supported preference keys, and surface user feedback states in error SnackBars.
- **Help Enhancements**: Curate tutorial assets, enable deep-linking into sections, and provide a search or filter affordance for large knowledge bases.
- **Testing Sprint**: Prioritize pure-Dart unit tests before UI harnesses to accelerate CI. Establish coverage gates for models/algorithms, then extend to repositories and widgets.
- **Performance Pass**: Capture timeline traces for complex automata, cache expensive computations (layout, conversions), and budget frame updates below 16 ms on flagship devices.
- **Accessibility Review**: Run semantics debugger, ensure focus traversal matches visual order, supply descriptive labels for icons, and verify color contrast ratios exceed 4.5:1.

## üìã PRIORITY ORDER
1. Expand automated test coverage across models, algorithms, services, and widgets.
2. Profile and optimize performance for large automata and long simulations.
3. Close accessibility gaps (semantics, keyboard/touch targets, high contrast).
4. Harden Settings persistence/UX through QA and cross-platform validation.
5. Polish Help content, discoverability, and analytics instrumentation.

## üéØ SUCCESS METRIC
```bash
flutter test
flutter run -d 89B37587-4BC2-4560-ACEA-8B65C649FFC8
# Tests should pass, the app should launch without runtime regressions,
# and Settings/Help flows must remain functional across supported platforms.
```

## üìä CURRENT STATUS
- **Core Functionality**: ‚úÖ Complete (85-90%)
- **UI Implementation**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Mobile Optimization**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **File Operations**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Test Suite**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration-heavy; unit/widget coverage still missing
- **Remaining Focus**: Unit tests, performance profiling, accessibility polish, Settings/Help QA
