PENDING VERIFICATION (requires Flutter SDK):
---------------------------------------------

⏳ 1. Run ./run_golden_tests.sh
   Command: ./run_golden_tests.sh
   Expected: All 80 golden tests pass
   Status: Cannot run without Flutter SDK

⏳ 2. Run full test suite
   Command: flutter test
   Expected: No regressions, 264+ tests passing
   Status: Cannot run without Flutter SDK

⏳ 3. Verify golden test updates work
   Command: flutter test --update-goldens test/goldens/
   Expected: Golden files update successfully
   Status: Cannot run without Flutter SDK


MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
------------------------------

Please run the following commands to complete verification:

1. Verify all golden tests pass:
   $ ./run_golden_tests.sh

2. Verify no regressions in existing tests:
   $ flutter test

3. Verify at least 264+ tests pass overall:
   $ flutter test | grep -E "All tests passed|tests passed"

4. (Optional) Test golden file updates:
   $ flutter test --update-goldens test/goldens/canvas/automaton_canvas_goldens_test.dart
   $ flutter test test/goldens/canvas/automaton_canvas_goldens_test.dart

is ready for final testing when Flutter is available.

Golden test count: 80 ✓ (requirement: 10+)
Golden image files: 49 ✓
CI workflow: Valid ✓
Documentation: Complete ✓

Next step: Run verification commands above with Flutter SDK available.
