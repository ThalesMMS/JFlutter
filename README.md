## Project Status

**Status:** Work in Progress – the core learning workflows are available while UI polish and advanced visualisations are still being built.

## Highlights

### Learning tools
- Touch-friendly canvas for creating and editing automata
- Step-by-step simulators for finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines
- Grammar editors with validation and conversion helpers
- Inline explanations and diagnostics to support classroom use

### Algorithms shipped in the app
- Conversions between NFA, DFA, and regular expressions
- DFA minimisation and automaton simulation traces
- Grammar analysis utilities and the Pumping Lemma training game
- Single-tape Turing machine construction and execution

### User experience and performance
- Material 3 interface with light and dark themes
- Adaptive layouts for phones, tablets, desktops, and the web
- Optimised canvas rendering (viewport culling, level-of-detail drawing, and highlight tracing)
- Persistent trace management across simulators and resilient import/export flows for JFLAP XML, JSON, and SVG

### Offline examples
The repository bundles ready-to-use examples covering DFAs, NFAs, CFGs, PDAs, and Turing Machines in `jflutter_js/examples/`. They are declared in `pubspec.yaml` so the material is available without a network connection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.24.0+
- Dart SDK 3.8.0+
- Android Studio / VS Code (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ThalesMMS/jflutter.git
cd jflutter

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### Android release signing

Android release builds are signed with the `dev.jflutter.app` application ID. The Gradle script loads release keystore
credentials from `android/key.properties`, which can now be generated from environment variables using
`android/scripts/create_key_properties.sh`.

1. Generate or obtain a release keystore (for example `android/keystores/jflutter-release.jks`). Keep this file out of
   version control.
2. Export the following environment variables before building or running the helper script:
   - `JFLUTTER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
   - `JFLUTTER_KEY_ALIAS`
   - `JFLUTTER_KEY_PASSWORD`
   - *(optional)* `JFLUTTER_KEYSTORE_PATH` (defaults to `keystores/jflutter-release.jks`, relative to `android/`)
3. Run `./android/scripts/create_key_properties.sh` to generate `android/key.properties` from the exported values.

For CI/CD, store the keystore and credential values as encrypted secrets. During the workflow, recreate the keystore file
and call the helper script before `flutter build`. Example (GitHub Actions):

```bash
mkdir -p android/keystores
echo "$JFLUTTER_KEYSTORE_BASE64" | base64 --decode > android/keystores/jflutter-release.jks
export JFLUTTER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="$JFLUTTER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
export JFLUTTER_KEY_ALIAS="$JFLUTTER_KEY_ALIAS"
export JFLUTTER_KEY_PASSWORD="$JFLUTTER_KEY_PASSWORD"
./android/scripts/create_key_properties.sh
```

### Platform Support
- **Android** – Primary target with touch-first workflows
- **iOS** – Daily-driver support, verified on current iOS devices
- **Web** – Responsive build suitable for classroom demos
- **Desktop** – Windows, macOS, and Linux builds share the same UI

## How to Use

### Creating an Automaton
1. Open the **FSA** workspace.
2. Add states with the **+** action and drag them into place.
3. Choose the arrow tool to connect states with transitions.
4. Double tap to edit state names or toggle initial/final markers.
5. Run conversions or minimisation from the algorithms panel.

### Testing Strings
1. Enter a string in the simulation panel.
2. Select **Simulate** to execute the automaton.
3. Inspect the trace output or canvas highlights to understand each step.

### Working with Grammars
1. Open the **Grammar** workspace.
2. Provide the grammar metadata and production rules.
3. Use the available algorithms to convert or analyse the grammar.
4. Test sample strings directly within the editor.

## Testing

### Test Suite Overview

Run `flutter test` (Flutter 3.24.0+ / Dart 3.8.0+) to execute the full suite. Tests are organised to mirror the architecture:

- **Algorithm validation** – `test/unit/` keeps DFA/NFA conversions, grammar analysis, and regex tooling aligned with the references.
- **Core services** – `test/core/services/` verifies utilities such as the simulation highlight broadcaster.
- **Canvas features** – `test/features/canvas/graphview/` exercises controllers, mappers, and models for the interactive canvas.
- **Integration** – `test/integration/io/` performs round-trips across JFLAP XML, JSON, SVG, and the offline example bundle.
- **Widget harnesses** – `test/widget/presentation/` drives UI flows while production widgets are completed.

### Placeholder and Pending Work

- `test/widget/presentation/visualizations_test.dart` intentionally fails to track the future golden-test pipeline.
- Temporary widget stubs live in `test/widget/presentation/ux_error_handling_test.dart` until the design-system components ship.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test suites
flutter test test/unit/                    # Core algorithm suites
flutter test test/features/                # Feature-level canvas suites
flutter test test/integration/             # Integration tests
flutter test test/widget/                  # Widget harnesses

# Run with code coverage
flutter test --coverage
lcov --list coverage/lcov.info

# Static analysis
flutter analyze
```

## Reference Implementation Methodology

During the ongoing migration we rely on the projects stored in `References/` as the source of truth for algorithms and data structures. The Dart repositories and the Python `automata-main` module provide validation checkpoints while the Flutter core is rebuilt.

### Validation Approach
The `References/` directory contains authoritative implementations used as the source of truth for algorithms and data structures during the migration process. Each algorithm modification is cross-validated against these references to ensure correctness and maintainability.

### Reference Usage Process
1. **Algorithm Development** - Implement new algorithms based on reference implementations
2. **Cross-Validation** - Compare outputs with reference implementations
3. **Test Suite Validation** - Validate against reference test cases
4. **Performance Benchmarking** - Ensure performance meets or exceeds references
5. **Documentation** - Record any deviations with rationale in `docs/reference-deviations.md`

### Quality Assurance
- **Algorithm Coverage** - Deterministic automata, grammar, and regex suites in `test/unit/` back the domain layer.
- **Integration Guardrails** - Serialization and examples are validated through the IO round-trip suites in `test/integration/io/`.
- **UI Exercisers** - Canvas and control widgets are kept regression-safe via the harnesses in `test/widget/presentation/`, with golden coverage tracked by the pending `visualizations_test.dart` placeholder.
- **Performance Monitoring** - Regular benchmarking against reference implementations.
- **Deviation Tracking** - All deviations documented with impact assessment and cross-checked with references.
- **Continuous Validation** - Ongoing comparison with reference implementations.

### Reference Maintenance
- **Version Control** - References maintained in separate directories
- **Update Process** - Regular updates to reference implementations
- **Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility with reference API changes
- **Documentation** - Keep reference usage documentation current
