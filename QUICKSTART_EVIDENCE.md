### Verification Commands Used
```bash
# Build verification
flutter build macos

# Launch verification  
flutter run -d macos

# Process verification
ps aux | grep flutter
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get name of every process whose name contains "jflutter"'

# Application properties verification
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get properties of process "jflutter"'

# Screenshot capture
screencapture -T 1 -x ~/Desktop/jflutter_quickstart_evidence.png
```

## Conclusion
The JFlutter application has been successfully:
1. ✅ Built for macOS platform
2. ✅ Launched and running
3. ✅ Verified as active and responsive
4. ✅ Evidence captured via screenshot
5. ✅ System properties documented

The quickstart execution demonstrates that the JFlutter application is fully functional on macOS and ready for use.
