## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   ‚Üí Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: Extract entities ‚Üí model tasks
   ‚Üí contracts/: Each file ‚Üí contract test task
   ‚Üí research.md: Extract decisions ‚Üí setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   ‚Üí Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   ‚Üí Core: models, services, CLI commands
   ‚Üí Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   ‚Üí Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ‚Üí All contracts have tests?
   ‚Üí All entities have models?
   ‚Üí All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Follow Flutter clean architecture patterns
- Ensure mobile-optimized touch interactions
- Maintain JFLAP file format compatibility
- Implement accessibility features per research.md
