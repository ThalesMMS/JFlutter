## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Status Overview *(updated this week)*

- **Weekly Summary**: Core grammar/automaton conversions, simulators, and the multi-tab mobile UI are implemented and covered by integration tests. File operations now export PNG/SVG and parse JFLAP XML. Remaining gaps include LR-specific PDA conversion, context-free pumping lemma support, and advanced accessibility/performance polish.
- **Outstanding Areas**: LR/SLR PDA conversion, context-free pumping lemma tooling, accessibility, input batch tooling, and L-system workflows remain unsatisfied by the current codebase.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a computer science student or educator, I want to create, manipulate, and analyze formal language automata and grammars on my mobile device, so that I can learn theoretical computer science concepts anywhere and perform the same operations that I can on desktop JFLAP.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they select "New FSA", **Then** they can create a finite state automaton by adding states and transitions with touch gestures
2. **Given** a user has created an automaton, **When** they input a test string, **Then** the system simulates the automaton and shows the acceptance/rejection result
3. **Given** a user has an NFA, **When** they select "Convert to DFA", **Then** the system performs the subset construction algorithm and displays the equivalent DFA
4. **Given** a user has a context-free grammar, **When** they select "Parse with CYK", **Then** the system performs CYK parsing and shows the parse table
5. **Given** a user has created an automaton, **When** they save it, **Then** the system persists the automaton data locally on the device
6. **Given** a user is working with a large automaton, **When** they interact with it on mobile, **Then** the interface remains responsive and touch-friendly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user creates an automaton with no accepting states?
- How does the system handle very large automata (100+ states) on mobile devices?
- What happens when a user inputs an invalid string for parsing?
- How does the system handle memory constraints when processing complex grammars?
- What happens when a user tries to simulate an infinite string on a finite automaton?
