# Flutter App Compilation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of the JFlutter automaton theory application development. It consolidates build status, the outcome of the latest maintenance PRs, and the next actionable items for the team.

## 🔍 Build & Test Validation
- :warning: **Local Flutter tooling unavailable.** Attempts to run `flutter --version` and `dart --version` failed because the SDKs are not installed on the current environment. As a result, `flutter test` / `flutter build` could not be executed locally. Run `make ci` or `./scripts/ci_pipeline.sh` once Flutter is provisioned.
- ✅ **Repository state is clean.** Latest merges are present locally (HEAD at `work` branch) and there are no uncommitted changes blocking automation.
- 🔄 **Action required:** Re-run the pipeline or a local build once Flutter tooling is available to confirm the stability of the recent changes. The new CI helper (`make ci`) bootstraps all local packages before linting/testing to avoid partial migrations.

## ✅ Completed Work (Current Week)
### Stability & Lifecycle
- Added mounted state guards to the TM canvas transition updates to avoid setState calls on disposed widgets (#106).
- Hardened the File Operations panel with additional mounted checks and loading helpers to keep async handlers safe (#107).

### State Management
- Introduced an explicit `ProviderSubscription` in `_TMPageState` to dispose listeners correctly when the page is rebuilt (#108).

### Testing
- Created dedicated widget coverage for the PDA Simulation Panel, exercising accepted/rejected runs and UI feedback paths (#109).

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks
1. **Environment & CI Restoration**
   - Install/configure the Flutter SDK in the execution environment.
   - Re-enable automated `flutter test` execution to cover the growing widget test suite.
2. **Regression Test Sweep**
   - After SDK setup, execute the full widget and integration test packages to confirm no regressions from the lifecycle fixes.
3. **Documentation Sync**
   - Cross-check CHANGELOG and README sections with the latest stability improvements to keep user-facing docs accurate.
4. **Performance & Accessibility Follow-up**
   - Resume earlier backlog items around large automata performance and accessibility tooling once stability validation is complete.

## 🔧 Next Steps
1. **Provision Flutter Tooling** – Prepare the CI runner or local machine with Flutter so the pending tests can run.
2. **Execute Test Suite** – Run `flutter test` focusing on the widget suite introduced this week.
3. **Monitor File Operations UX** – Validate that the mounted guards removed the previously observed crashes when dismissing dialogs mid-operation.
4. **Track TM Page Listener Lifecycle** – Confirm via manual QA that listeners detach properly during navigation flows.

## 📊 Progress Summary
- **Focus of the Week:** Stabilization and test hardening for automaton interaction widgets.
- **Recent Merges:** #106 (TM canvas guards), #107 (File operations panel safety), #108 (TM page subscription management), #109 (PDA simulation widget tests).
- **Build Status:** Blocked locally pending Flutter SDK availability; CI rerun required.
- **Quality Trend:** Widget coverage increasing, lifecycle bugs being addressed.

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [x] Guard TM canvas updates with mounted checks (#106).
- [x] Ensure File Operations panel defers UI updates until mounted (#107).
- [x] Manage TM editor subscriptions to avoid leaks (#108).
- [x] Provide widget tests for PDA simulation panel (#109).
- [ ] Validate the full Flutter test suite on a configured environment.
- [ ] Reconfirm performance and accessibility backlog after stability passes.
