# Quickstart Guide: Verifying Feature Removal

This guide provides the steps to verify that the out-of-scope features have been successfully removed from the JFlutter application.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verify Removal of L-Systems
- **Action**: Navigate through the application's UI.
- **Expected Result**: There should be no tab, menu item, or button related to "L-Systems," "Turtle Graphics," or "Fractals." The application should not crash or show any errors related to missing L-System components.

### 2. Verify Removal of Advanced Parsing
- **Action**: Open the grammar analysis or conversion sections of the application.
- **Expected Result**: There should be no options to select "LR," "SLR," or "LALR" parsing. The only available parsing-related algorithm should be "LL" or "CYK" as per the updated scope.

### 3. Verify Removal of Brute-Force Parser
- **Action**: Check the available parsing strategies in the grammar section.
- **Expected Result**: The "brute-force" parsing option should no longer be available. The application should use the remaining valid parsing strategies without error.

### 4. Verify Documentation Alignment
- **Action**: Review the `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and other user-facing documentation.
- **Expected Result**: All references to the removed features should be gone. The documentation should accurately reflect the current, focused feature set of the application.

If all the above steps are successful, the feature removal is complete and verified.
