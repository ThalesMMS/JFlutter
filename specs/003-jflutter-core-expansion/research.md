# Research: JFlutter Core Expansion and Interoperability

## Technology Stack Research

### Flutter 3.16+ / Dart 3.0+ Integration
**Decision**: Use Flutter 3.16+ with Dart 3.0+ for enhanced performance and language features
**Rationale**: 
- Enhanced null safety and sealed classes for immutable automaton models
- Improved performance for canvas rendering and algorithm execution
- Better package ecosystem and tooling support
- Multi-platform deployment capabilities
**Alternatives considered**: Flutter 3.15 (missing performance improvements), Dart 2.x (lacks sealed classes)

### State Management with Riverpod
**Decision**: Riverpod as primary state management solution
**Rationale**:
- Compile-time safety with provider types
- Excellent testing capabilities with ProviderScope
- Clean dependency injection for automaton algorithms
- Reactive updates for real-time simulation visualization
**Alternatives considered**: Bloc (more boilerplate), Provider (less type safety), GetX (not recommended for Flutter)

- Independent testing and development
- Future potential for pub.dev publication
**Alternatives considered**: Monorepo without packages (less modularity), separate repositories (complexity)

### Visualization Architecture
**Decision**: Decoupled rendering engines in viz package with canvas layers
**Rationale**:
- Independent visualization from core algorithm logic
- Multiple rendering backends (Canvas, SVG, PNG export)
- Touch gesture handling separated from business logic
- Performance optimization for large automaton visualizations
**Alternatives considered**: Tightly coupled rendering (harder to test), single rendering backend (less flexible)

## Performance Optimization Research

### Canvas Rendering Performance
**Decision**: Custom painters with efficient state management for 60fps rendering
**Rationale**:
- Smooth user experience during automaton editing
- Real-time algorithm visualization without lag
- Efficient handling of large state spaces
- Mobile-optimized rendering pipeline
**Alternatives considered**: Widget-based rendering (performance issues), WebGL (complexity)

### Algorithm Execution Performance
**Decision**: Throttled execution with batched UI updates for >10k simulation steps
**Rationale**:
- Responsive UI during long-running simulations
- Progress indication for complex algorithms
- Memory management for large automaton state spaces
- Cancellable execution for user control
**Alternatives considered**: Synchronous execution (UI blocking), Web Workers (complexity)

### Memory Management Strategy
**Decision**: Immutable configurations with efficient copying for time-travel debugging
**Rationale**:
- Memory-efficient storage of execution traces
- Fast state restoration for debugging
- Garbage collection optimization
- Large automaton support without memory leaks
**Alternatives considered**: Mutable state (unsafe), deep copying (performance issues)

## Testing Strategy Research

### Test Coverage Approach
**Decision**: Comprehensive testing with unit, integration, widget, and golden tests
**Rationale**:
- Algorithm correctness validation with deterministic tests
- UI regression prevention with golden tests
- End-to-end workflow validation with integration tests
- Performance regression detection
**Alternatives considered**: Unit tests only (insufficient coverage), manual testing (unreliable)

### Property-Based Testing
**Decision**: Property-based testing for algorithm validation where applicable
**Rationale**:
- Automatic discovery of edge cases in automaton algorithms
- Mathematical property validation for language operations
- Regression testing for complex algorithm interactions
- Educational value in understanding algorithm correctness
**Alternatives considered**: Example-based testing only (limited coverage), no testing (unreliable)

### Regression Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Canonical example library with automated regression testing
**Rationale**:
- Consistent behavior across algorithm implementations
- Educational example validation
- Performance benchmark maintenance
- .jff compatibility verification
**Alternatives considered**: Manual testing (error-prone), no regression testing (unreliable)

## Interoperability Research

### .jff File Format Compatibility
**Decision**: Faithful .jff import/export with comprehensive validation
**Rationale**:
- Seamless migration from original JFLAP
- Educational continuity for existing users
- Regression testing with original JFLAP examples
