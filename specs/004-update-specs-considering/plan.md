# Implementation Plan: Update Specs to Align with Requisitos.md

**Branch**: `004-update-specs-considering` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: `/Users/thales/Documents/GitHub/jflutter/specs/004-update-specs-considering/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/thales/Documents/GitHub/jflutter/specs/004-update-specs-considering/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the process of removing out-of-scope features (L-Systems, advanced parsing, brute-force parsers) from the JFlutter codebase and documentation to align with the updated `Requisitos.md`. The focus is on ensuring a clean and compliant code-base that adheres to the project's educational goals.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Dart 3.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: Flutter 3.16+, Riverpod
**Storage**: N/A (Feature removal)
**Testing**: flutter test (verification of removed features)
**Target Platform**: All (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)
**Project Type**: mobile
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: All related code and documentation must be removed.
**Scale/Scope**: Project-wide removal of specified features.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Educational Focus Compliance
- [x] Feature aligns with formal language theory curriculum (by removing non-core features)
- [x] Mobile-first UX design approach (unaffected)
- [x] No backend dependencies required (unaffected)
- [x] Educational value clearly defined (by focusing on core syllabus)

### Technical Standards Compliance
- [x] Flutter 3.16+ / Dart 3.0+ compatibility
- [x] Clean architecture (Presentation/Core/Data) structure
- [x] Riverpod state management approach
- [x] Immutable models with freezed/sealed classes
- [x] JSON serialization for DTOs

### Quality & Testing Compliance
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage planned (tests for removed features should be deleted)
- [x] Static analysis and linting configured
- [x] Performance budgets defined (unaffected)
- [x] Deterministic algorithm testing approach
- [x] Immutable trace recording capability

### Mobile & Accessibility Compliance
- [x] Touch gesture support (pinch, pan, tap)
- [x] Material 3 design principles
- [x] Collapsible panels for space efficiency
- [x] Overflow prevention for small screens
- [x] Basic accessibility (labels, contrast)

### Security & File Handling Compliance
- [x] Sandboxed file operations
- [x] Input validation for external files
- [x] No dynamic code execution
- [x] Path traversal prevention
