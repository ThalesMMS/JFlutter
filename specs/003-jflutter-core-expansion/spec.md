## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (educational value)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for educators and students, not developers
- üì± Mobile-first user experience requirements
- üéØ Educational alignment with formal language theory curriculum

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "automaton editor" without touch gestures), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas for educational tools**:
   - Educational level and learning objectives
   - Mobile interaction patterns (gestures, screen sizes)
   - Algorithm visualization requirements
   - File format compatibility (.jff, JSON, etc.)
   - Performance targets for simulations
   - Accessibility requirements for students
   - Export/import capabilities

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a computer science student learning formal language theory, I want to use JFlutter to explore advanced automata concepts through comprehensive language operations, robust PDA simulation, advanced regex parsing, single-tape Turing machines, and seamless interoperability with existing JFLAP files, so that I can gain deep understanding of theoretical computer science concepts with modern mobile-first tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a finite automaton, **When** I perform language operations (union, intersection, complement, concatenation, star, reverse, shuffle), **Then** I can see step-by-step execution traces with Œµ-closure diagnostics
2. **Given** I create a pushdown automaton, **When** I configure multiple acceptance modes (final state, empty stack, both), **Then** I can run non-deterministic simulations with trace folding and clear error messages
3. **Given** I write a regular expression, **When** I convert it through AST to Thompson NFA, **Then** I can visualize the complete parsing pipeline with basic operator support
4. **Given** I design a Turing machine, **When** I configure non-deterministic transitions, **Then** I can execute with time-travel debugging and building blocks
5. **Given** I have a JFLAP file, **When** I import it into JFlutter, **Then** I can work with the automaton seamlessly and export back to .jff format

### Edge Cases
- What happens when language operations result in empty or infinite languages?
- How does the system handle non-deterministic branching with exponential state spaces?
- What occurs when importing malformed .jff files or unsupported automaton types?
- How does the system manage memory for large Turing machine simulations with complex tape configurations?
- What happens when regex parsing encounters ambiguous or invalid expressions?
