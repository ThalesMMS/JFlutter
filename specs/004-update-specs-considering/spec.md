# Feature Specification: Update Specs to Align with Requisitos.md

**Feature Branch**: `004-update-specs-considering`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update specs considering the new requisitos.md file"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT is being changed and WHY.
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement the removal.
- üë• Written for project stakeholders and developers.
- üéØ To align project scope with the official course syllabus.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project stakeholder, I want to formally document the removal of out-of-scope features from the project specifications, ensuring that all development and documentation align with the updated `Requisitos.md`, which reflects the official course syllabus.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the project documentation, **When** a developer or stakeholder reviews it, **Then** there should be no mention of L-Systems, advanced parsing (LR/SLR), or brute-force parsers for unrestricted grammars as supported features.
2.  **Given** the project's codebase, **When** it is audited, **Then** no active implementation of the removed features should be present.
3.  **Given** the project's constitution, **When** it is reviewed, **Then** it must explicitly list the excluded features to prevent future re-implementation.

### Edge Cases
- How are existing files that reference these features handled? They must be updated or removed.
- How do we prevent these features from being accidentally re-introduced in the future? The constitution update serves as the primary guardrail.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The project specifications MUST be updated to remove any requirement for L-Systems, including turtle graphics and fractal generation.
- **FR-002**: The project specifications MUST be updated to remove any requirement for advanced parsing techniques, specifically LR, SLR(1), and LALR parsing, including table generation and conflict resolution.
- **FR-003**: The project specifications MUST be updated to remove any requirement for a brute-force parser for Unrestricted Grammars.
- **FR-004**: All existing project documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, other specs) MUST be updated to reflect the removal of these features.
- **FR-005**: The project's constitution MUST be updated to explicitly forbid the implementation of the removed features.

### Key Entities to be Removed
- **LSystem**: Any models or algorithms related to L-System generation.
- **TurtleState**: Any models representing the state for turtle graphics.
- **ParseTable (LR/SLR variants)**: The parts of the `ParseTable` model and related logic that handle LR, SLR, and LALR parsing.
- **GrammarParser (Brute-Force)**: The brute-force parsing strategy within the `GrammarParser`.
