# Feature Specification: Mobile-Optimized JFlutter Core Features

**Feature Branch**: `002-title-mobile-optimized`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Atualizar as especifica√ß√µes para remover determinadas m√°quinas avan√ßadas que n√£o ser√£o necess√°rias neste projeto (como Moore Machine, Multi-Tape Turing Machine e L-System). O aplicativo deve ser otimizado para dispositivos m√≥veis, e ter√° as seguintes abas (que podem ser abreviadas): Finite Automaton, Pushdown Automaton, Turing Machine, Grammar, Regular Expression, Pumping Lemma. Os c√≥digos java dentro da pasta JFLAP_source devem ser usados como refer√™ncia de funcionalidades para as sess√µes que estamos portando, bem como refer√™ncia l√≥gica dos algoritmos. A interface, em cada aba, deve ser clean, com menus expans√≠veis e barras de ferramentas que n√£o ocupem muito espa√ßo no layout padr√£o da aba."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A computer science student or educator needs to interact with various automata and formal language concepts on their mobile device. They want to access six core features through a clean, mobile-optimized interface: Finite Automaton, Pushdown Automaton, Turing Machine, Grammar, Regular Expression, and Pumping Lemma. Each feature should provide the essential functionality from the original JFLAP application, adapted for touch interaction and limited screen space.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the mobile app, **When** they navigate between tabs, **Then** they can access all six core features (Finite Automaton, Pushdown Automaton, Turing Machine, Grammar, Regular Expression, Pumping Lemma)
2. **Given** a user is in any feature tab, **When** they interact with the interface, **Then** the menus and toolbars remain compact and don't obstruct the main workspace
3. **Given** a user needs to access advanced features, **When** they tap on expandable menu items, **Then** additional tools and options become available without cluttering the default view
4. **Given** a user is working with automata, **When** they perform operations, **Then** the system behaves consistently with the original JFLAP Java implementation logic
5. **Given** a user has created or modified content, **When** they switch between tabs, **Then** their work is preserved and accessible when they return

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user rotates their device between portrait and landscape modes?
- How does the system handle limited screen space on smaller mobile devices?
- What occurs when users try to access removed advanced features (e.g., Moore Machine, Multi-Tape Turing Machine, L-System) if they were previously available?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide six core feature tabs: Finite Automaton, Pushdown Automaton, Turing Machine, Grammar, Regular Expression, and Pumping Lemma
- **FR-002**: System MUST optimize all interfaces for mobile device interaction (touch, limited screen space)
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement expandable menus that remain collapsed by default to preserve screen space
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide compact toolbars that don't obstruct the main workspace area
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove or prevent access to legacy advanced automata features (including Moore Machine, Multi-Tape Turing Machine, and L-System capabilities)
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain functional consistency with the original JFLAP Java implementation for core algorithms
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow tab abbreviations for better mobile display [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific abbreviations should be used for each tab?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve user work when switching between tabs
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide responsive layout that adapts to different mobile screen sizes
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all interactive elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction

### Key Entities
- **Feature Tab**: Represents one of the six core automata/formal language features, contains the main workspace and associated tools
- **Expandable Menu**: A collapsible interface element that provides access to additional tools and options without cluttering the default view
- **Compact Toolbar**: A space-efficient collection of frequently used tools that remains visible but doesn't dominate the screen
- **Mobile Workspace**: The main interaction area optimized for touch input and limited screen real estate
