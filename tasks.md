# Weekly Task Audit

## ✅ Completed This Week
- **Settings experience finalized** – Settings page wiring covers theme, canvas, general preferences, save/reset actions, and error handling, confirming the task delivery. 【F:lib/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart†L13-L129】
- **Help & Documentation hub delivered** – Responsive Help page with sectioned tutorials, quick start dialog, and navigation across key topics is live. 【F:lib/presentation/pages/help_page.dart†L15-L151】
- **Test coverage snapshot documented** – `TEST_COVERAGE_ASSESSMENT.md` inventories the current suites and highlights missing coverage areas for follow-up. 【F:TEST_COVERAGE_ASSESSMENT.md†L1-L76】

## 🔄 Replanned / Carry-Over
- **Unit test expansion** – Populate `test/unit/` models, algorithms, and services suites per coverage assessment to lift confidence in core logic. 【F:TEST_COVERAGE_ASSESSMENT.md†L33-L64】
- **Widget regression coverage** – Build targeted widget tests in `test/widget/` for complex components (canvas, panels, settings cards). 【F:TEST_COVERAGE_ASSESSMENT.md†L65-L74】
- **Performance profiling** – Schedule passes for large automata rendering/memory usage to meet responsiveness goals. 【F:DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md†L50-L63】
- **Accessibility improvements** – Add screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast themes after QA. 【F:DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md†L63-L69】

## 🆕 Newly Identified Follow-Ups
- **Settings persistence validation** – Add integration/unit coverage ensuring `SettingsViewModel` persists to storage correctly under success and error paths.
- **Help content indexing** – Provide searchable/linked index so Help topics are reachable from in-app contexts (deep links or search).
- **Documentation alignment** – Keep README testing commands in sync with suite layout (updated in this pass). 【F:README.md†L181-L198】

## 📌 Notes
- Continue using `flutter test` for end-to-end validation and add `--coverage` runs to track improvements as new unit tests land.
- Prioritize automation around regression suites before expanding feature surface again.
