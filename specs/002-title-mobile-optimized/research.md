# Research: Mobile-Optimized JFlutter Core Features

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Feature**: Mobile-Optimized JFlutter Core Features  
**Branch**: 002-title-mobile-optimized

## Research Summary
This research addresses the technical decisions needed to port JFLAP's core automata features to a mobile-optimized Flutter application, focusing on clean interface design, expandable menus, and compact toolbars while maintaining algorithmic consistency with the original Java implementation.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Flutter State Management
**Decision**: Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier for state management  
**Rationale**: 
- Provider is lightweight and well-suited for educational apps
- Excellent Flutter integration and documentation
- Supports complex state sharing between automata features
- Good performance for mobile devices
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Riverpod: More complex, overkill for this scope
- Bloc: Too heavyweight for educational app
- setState: Not scalable for complex automata state

### 2. Canvas Rendering for Automata
**Decision**: CustomPainter with Canvas API for automata visualization  
**Rationale**:
- Native Flutter performance for drawing operations
- Full control over automata rendering (states, transitions, labels)
- Smooth animations and touch interactions
- Consistent with Flutter's rendering pipeline
**Alternatives considered**:
- SVG rendering: Limited interactivity
- HTML Canvas (web): Not suitable for mobile
- Third-party graphics libraries: Unnecessary complexity

### 3. Local Storage Strategy
**Decision**: SharedPreferences for user work persistence  
**Rationale**:
- Simple key-value storage for automata definitions
- Built-in Flutter support, no external dependencies
- Sufficient for educational use cases
- Automatic platform-specific implementation
**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite: Overkill for simple automata storage
- Hive: Additional dependency
- File system: More complex serialization needed

### 4. Mobile UI Architecture
**Decision**: Bottom navigation with expandable drawer menus  
**Rationale**:
- Bottom navigation is mobile-standard for tab switching
- Expandable drawers preserve screen space
- Familiar UX pattern for mobile users
- Easy thumb navigation on mobile devices
**Alternatives considered**:
- Top tabs: Less accessible on large phones
- Side navigation: Takes up horizontal space
- Modal dialogs: Disrupts workflow

### 5. Touch Interaction Design
**Decision**: GestureDetector with custom hit testing for automata elements  
**Rationale**:
- Precise touch handling for small automata elements
- Support for drag, tap, long-press gestures
- Customizable touch targets for accessibility
- Smooth interaction feedback
**Alternatives considered**:
- InkWell: Limited customization
- GestureDetector alone: Too low-level
- Third-party gesture libraries: Unnecessary complexity

### 6. Responsive Layout Strategy
**Decision**: MediaQuery-based responsive design with breakpoints  
**Rationale**:
- Native Flutter responsive design
- Adapts to different screen sizes (4"-7")
- Maintains usability across device types
- No external dependencies
**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed layouts: Poor mobile experience
- Third-party responsive libraries: Unnecessary
- Platform-specific layouts: Code duplication

### 7. Tab Abbreviation Strategy
**Decision**: Context-aware abbreviations with full labels on hover/long-press  
**Rationale**:
- Preserves screen space on smaller devices
- Maintains clarity through context
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Consistent with mobile UX patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Always full labels: Takes too much space
- Always abbreviated: Reduces clarity
- Icon-only: Requires learning curve

### 8. Algorithm Porting Strategy
**Decision**: Direct port of Java algorithms to Dart with Flutter-specific optimizations
**Rationale**:
- Maintains functional consistency with original JFLAP
- Leverages existing algorithmic logic
- Dart's similarity to Java eases porting
- Flutter optimizations for mobile performance
**Alternatives considered**:
- Rewrite from scratch: Risk of behavioral differences
- WebAssembly port: Unnecessary complexity
- Hybrid approach: Inconsistent user experience

### 9. File Operations Lifecycle Safeguards
**Decision**: Gate file actions behind loading flags and `mounted` checks while surfacing contextual snackbars when the platform denies file access or when operations succeed/fail.
**Rationale**:
- Prevents crashes from `setState` calls after widget disposal in asynchronous dialogs, resolving the risk highlighted in regressions where the panel stayed mounted during file pickers.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/file_operations_panel.dart†L118-L200】【F:lib/presentation/widgets/file_operations_panel.dart†L313-L335】
- Disabling buttons during network/disk work avoids duplicate submissions and clarifies the current state to the user via explicit success/failure messaging.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/file_operations_panel.dart†L118-L200】【F:lib/presentation/widgets/file_operations_panel.dart†L313-L335】
- Communicates environment limitations (e.g., sandboxed file pickers) through snackbars, reducing silent failures.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/file_operations_panel.dart†L174-L195】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Leave the previous optimistic UI without guards (risk: `setState` after dispose and double submissions).
- Move file handling to a global provider and stream back results (adds latency and complexity without immediate UX gains).
- Block the UI with modal progress dialogs (heavier interaction cost for quick file saves/loads).

### 10. TM Metrics Subscription Management
**Decision**: Register a scoped `ProviderSubscription` in `initState` that feeds the metrics controller immediately and dispose it with the widget lifecycle.
**Rationale**:
- Ensures metrics-dependent sheets (simulation, algorithms, metrics) receive up-to-date readiness flags as soon as the page loads, mitigating stale data risks seen when listeners were rebuilt ad hoc.【F:lib/presentation/pages/tm_page.dart†L20-L117】
- Explicitly closing the subscription during disposal guards against memory leaks or background updates after leaving the page, which was a reported stability risk for long editing sessions.【F:lib/presentation/pages/tm_page.dart†L20-L40】
- Reusing the listener allows mobile layouts to keep FAB entry points responsive without duplicating Riverpod consumers per sheet.【F:lib/presentation/pages/tm_page.dart†L48-L117】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Call `ref.listen` inside `build` (risk: multiple redundant subscriptions and harder teardown).
- Poll metrics from widgets when sheets open (lag between edits and metrics state).
- Convert metrics to synchronous getters only (loses real-time updates during editing).

### 11. TM Canvas Asynchronous Safety
**Decision**: Guard transition dialogs and state updates with `mounted` checks and reset helpers to avoid updating disposed canvases after awaiting user input.
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates exceptions stemming from dialogs finishing after navigation away from the canvas, a recurring crash risk on mobile when dismissing sheets mid-edit.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/tm_canvas.dart†L224-L287】
- Automatically clears transition-adding mode if the dialog is cancelled, preventing ghost UI states that previously confused gesture handling.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/tm_canvas.dart†L224-L287】
- Maintains editor synchronization by notifying providers only when the widget remains active, preserving undo/redo expectations.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/tm_canvas.dart†L224-L299】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Trust Flutter’s scheduler without guards (risk: `setState` on disposed widgets).
- Recreate the canvas widget after every dialog (expensive rebuilds and gesture resets).
- Move dialogs to a separate overlay service (higher complexity for small safety improvement).

### 12. SVG Text Escaping for Exports
**Decision**: Escape all SVG text nodes and add regression tests covering special characters in state labels and transition symbols.
**Rationale**:
- Prevents malformed SVG output and potential injection vectors when users name states with XML-reserved characters, closing a high-severity export risk.【F:lib/data/services/file_operations_service.dart†L324-L370】
- Automated tests validate the escaping routine against a spectrum of special characters, ensuring future refactors preserve the guarantee.【F:test/data/services/file_operations_service_svg_test.dart†L14-L84】
- Keeps exports standards-compliant without requiring manual sanitization in the UI layer.【F:lib/data/services/file_operations_service.dart†L324-L370】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Trust user-entered labels (risk: broken SVGs and downstream parsing errors).
- Strip special characters (destroys intentional naming and loses parity with desktop JFLAP).
- Encode labels in base64 (overkill for textual editors and harms readability).

### 13. NFA→DFA Queue Optimization
**Decision**: Swap list-based worklists for `ListQueue`, track processed subsets, and cap conversions at 1000 generated states to guard mobile memory limits.
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates O(n) removals during subset construction, which previously degraded performance on large NFAs and risked frame drops on mid-tier phones.【F:lib/core/algorithms/nfa_to_dfa_converter.dart†L138-L207】
- Explicit processed tracking avoids re-enqueuing duplicates, reducing CPU churn and meeting latency goals for automata up to 200 states.【F:lib/core/algorithms/nfa_to_dfa_converter.dart†L142-L207】
- The safety cap prevents runaway conversions from exhausting device resources, directly addressing a production risk noted in weekly QA.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep list removals (risk: repeated shifting and jank for larger automata).
- Recursive conversion (risk: stack overflows on deep automata).
- Offload to background isolates (higher complexity without clear wins for current size targets).

### 14. DFA Minimizer Predecessor Map
**Decision**: Precompute predecessor sets per symbol/destination and process Hopcroft splitters via `ListQueue` to avoid repeated full scans.
**Rationale**:
- Reduces algorithmic complexity for each refinement step, eliminating the risk of quadratic loops that timed out during stress runs on 150-state automata.【F:lib/core/algorithms/dfa_minimizer.dart†L104-L193】
- Maintaining FIFO semantics with `ListQueue` preserves determinism of the output while improving responsiveness on mobile hardware.【F:lib/core/algorithms/dfa_minimizer.dart†L132-L188】
- Keeps memory overhead predictable by sharing predecessor sets instead of recomputing them per iteration.【F:lib/core/algorithms/dfa_minimizer.dart†L115-L130】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep scanning the full transition list every time (risk: timeouts on larger automata).
- Switch to recursive partition refinement (harder to profile and tune for mobile).
- Outsource minimization to native code (adds FFI maintenance burden).

### 15. FA→Regex State Elimination Caching
**Decision**: Cache incoming/outgoing transition buckets and reuse merged transitions when eliminating intermediate states.
**Rationale**:
- Avoids rebuilding transition lists from scratch on every elimination step, mitigating the latency risk seen in earlier profiling of grammar-heavy exercises.【F:lib/core/algorithms/fa_to_regex_converter.dart†L164-L273】
- Consolidates parallel paths with unioned regex strings, preserving correctness while curbing exponential string growth.【F:lib/core/algorithms/fa_to_regex_converter.dart†L213-L258】
- Keeps the resulting automaton deterministic for the extraction phase, aligning with UI expectations for previewing regex derivations.【F:lib/core/algorithms/fa_to_regex_converter.dart†L213-L273】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Rebuild transitions through nested loops per elimination (risk: repeated quadratic work).
- Emit intermediate regex fragments without caching (risk: duplicated work and inconsistent outputs).
- Use adjacency matrices (memory cost too high for mobile constraints).

### 16. PDA Simulation Panel Regression Tests
**Decision**: Add widget tests that simulate empty input, missing PDA context, and successful acceptance flows using provider overrides.
**Rationale**:
- Captures regressions in error messaging and success summaries that previously slipped into production due to manual-only verification, reducing QA risk for pedagogy-critical panels.【F:test/presentation/widgets/pda_simulation_panel_test.dart†L14-L125】
- Provider overrides keep tests hermetic and fast, encouraging continued coverage additions without bootstrapping the full app shell.【F:test/presentation/widgets/pda_simulation_panel_test.dart†L19-L125】
- Ensures future UI refactors respect snackbar copy and acceptance states relied upon in lesson plans.【F:test/presentation/widgets/pda_simulation_panel_test.dart†L82-L125】
**Alternatives considered**:
- Depend solely on integration tests (slower feedback and harder failure triage).
- Rely on manual QA scripts (risk: inconsistent validation across releases).
- Mock only service layers (misses widget composition issues).

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Use `ListQueue` for subset construction in NFA→DFA conversion to preserve O(1) dequeue operations and limit generated states to protect mobile memory budgets.【F:lib/core/algorithms/nfa_to_dfa_converter.dart†L138-L207】
- Precompute predecessor maps during DFA minimization to eliminate repeated full scans inside Hopcroft iterations, maintaining deterministic processing order.【F:lib/core/algorithms/dfa_minimizer.dart†L104-L188】
- Cache incoming/outgoing transition groups during FA→regex elimination to reduce repeated combinations and keep regex growth manageable.【F:lib/core/algorithms/fa_to_regex_converter.dart†L164-L258】
- Continue isolating expensive paint operations with `RepaintBoundary` and lazy-loading large automata where applicable (unchanged recommendation).

### Accessibility Features
- Minimum 44pt touch targets for automata elements
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Voice-over support for automata descriptions
- Snackbars now rely on default red/green fills for error/success states, so we must audit color contrast against WCAG AA to ensure the new feedback remains perceivable for low-vision users.【F:lib/presentation/widgets/file_operations_panel.dart†L320-L335】
