# Development Log - JFlutter Project Progress

## Session Summary
**Date**: Current Session
**Objective**: Update documentation to reflect recent UI implementation progress
**Status**: Major UI implementation completed, documentation updated

## ‚úÖ Weekly PR Clarification Review
- **PR #109 ‚Äì PDA simulation panel tests**: Added widget coverage confirming the panel disables controls during execution and resets results, addressing prior uncertainty about regression coverage for asynchronous simulations.
- **PR #108 ‚Äì TM metrics subscription**: Introduced an explicit provider subscription that closes on dispose, resolving the question about metrics updates continuing after navigation changes.
- **PR #107 ‚Äì File operations panel guards**: Centralized loading handling and `mounted` checks so file pickers and SnackBars behave safely when dialogs close, closing the open doubt about error handling on unsupported platforms.
- **PR #106 ‚Äì TM canvas safety checks**: Added `mounted` guards around async canvas updates to settle reports of setState calls after widget disposal.
- **Navigation abbreviations**: Current home navigation uses the agreed labels `FSA`, `Grammar`, `PDA`, `TM`, `Regex`, and `Pumping`, confirming the clarification request about tab abbreviations has been implemented.
